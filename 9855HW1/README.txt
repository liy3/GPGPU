*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

This program can show four obj models same time, and each model is using different shaders, the top left is the teapot model with wood material, top right is sphere model with the material of Jupiter texture(Custom material), the bottom left is the torus model with brick material, and bottom right is a custom model, called minionMike, with metal material. It can rotate and the light is spinning.

1. Uncompress the file name 9855HW1.zip

   Now you will get a folder named 9855HW1, it has the files as below:
        1.GraphicLibrary folder
	2.lib folder 
	3.MathLibrary folder
	4.RealisticMesh folder contains:
          main.cpp
          RealisticMesh.vcxproj
	  GameMesh.vcxproj.filters
          models folder containing 4 obj models
          shaders folder containing 4 shaders
	  textures folder containing 4 kinds of textures
        5.RealsticMesh.sln
	6.RealsticMesh.v12.suo
        7.README.txt

2. Open the program.
   
   Click 9855HW1.sln file to open the solution/project.
